<h2>Create a profile</h2>
    <p>The first thing that you will need to do is make a profile for yourself. This will allow you to put in personal information such
    as your name and your email. It will be kept private. You will also have the option to upload a photo of yourself.</p>
<h2>Keep track of the states you have been to</h2>
    <p>Once your profile has been created, now you will have the opportunity to enter in all the States that you have been to and the
    places that you saw. The program will be able to differentiate where you have and have not been. </p>
<h2>What did you do when you were there</h2>
    <p>After you have entered the places that you have been to, you can now go into detail on the things that you did. Once you have done
     that, you can categorize it based on the type of activity. You will be presented with the categories so that you can group them
         accordingly. </p>
<h2>How would you rate your visit</h2>
    <p>You will be presented with a scale to determine how the visit went. It will be a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being fantastic and 1
     being horrible. There are a few factors to consider in your rating. You will provide a rating for the food, the people in the area,
    what things there were to do, and those will be averaged together to give you your overall rating. </p>
<h2>What is there to do in states that you haven't been to</h2>
    <p>The program will keep track of the states that you have not visited yet. Should you decide to see where you need to go, you will
    have the option to view those states.</p>
<h2>Suggestions on what to do in those states</h2>
    <p>For the states that you have not visited yet, you will have the option to explore possible activities that the state is known for. That
         will include the top ten restaurants, the top ten in activities, and the ten in places to see such as parks or museums.
